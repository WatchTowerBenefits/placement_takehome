It's all about the line of coverage for my team. We need to be able to see how our employer client's coverage has evolved across time.  Are terms consistent but rates are creeping up? Are we getting fair volumes discounts or is the carrier sneaking in costs? I really need to be able to see a product proposal in the context of what came before it.  Especially when some of our clients have up to a dozen lines with us -- Dental, Vision, Short Term Disability, AD&D, etc -- we have to cut out the noise so we can focus in on just one line, say Dental, and do a deep analysis of just Dental coverages for the given client across time.

ThreeFlow covers most of our bases when it comes to capturing product details that I care about. But the market changes and there are details that my employer clients want that aren't in your system. For example, your Pet Insurance products don't track dental cleanings and people LOVE that benefit. In addition, I still get one-off calls and emails from carriers telling me about special offers and value-adds that your app doesn't capture.  Can you please give us room to add in details that aren't in your list of standard attributes? Just make sure our competitors can't see our fields, because that's part of our special touch!

My group deals with coverage periods primarily. We sometimes get into product details but we really don't care about products that never materialize.  For every coverage that becomes a reality you have up to 15 products that represent an offer that we didn't take. When it comes to forecasting upcoming business I really just care about real, in-force coverage.
