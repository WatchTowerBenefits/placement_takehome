I love using ThreeFlow when I'm renewing coverage with my broker partners. Oftentimes we'll agree to keep the same contractual terms but extend the contract for another 12 months.  In that case, I have to create a new product in ThreeFlow even though nothing's changed -- we call this a "rate pass renewal" in the industry.  I'd love to be able to indicate that the contract date is pushed out and be done with it!

I use the product status field religously. It's a quick way for me to remember where I left things and where I need to pick up. Right now I have about 50 products in "in progress" because I'm waiting for my underwriting team to give me final details.  I refresh my "submitted" table about 10 times a day so that I can get on the phone with my broker partner if and when anything moves to "selected".  Of course, my supervisior is most concerned with the "rejected" numbers.

My team uses ThreeFlow for all of our business.  We often find ourselves needing to reference previous product terms when working on new business.  Unfortunately the UI only lets us see a single product at a time, and there isn't a convenient link to a product's ancestors.  If we had a way to quickly see the last three years of business we've done with an employer it would save us tons of time.  In short, we want to be able to navigate back through a line of coverage's history.
