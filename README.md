# ThreeFlow Placement Team Take Home Exercise

### Artifacts Provided
In this repository you'll find 5 artifacts:
* A schema file describing a portion of the application data model
* A collection of broker feedback
* A collection of carrier feedback
* A collection of internal stakeholder feedback
* A backlog of features that the placement team is considering

### Your Task
Using the information provided in the schema file and feedback sheets, your task is to choose ONE feature in the backlog and prepare a brief work plan (no more than one page) outlining your proposed approach given the requirements you know about.  We've provded a template that you may choose to use (`workplan_template.md`) or you may create your own. If you'd like to fold in any assumptions you've gathered from avaiable feedback, please state those assumptions explicitly in your plan.

You may prepare your work plan in whatever format you're comfortable with.  Please DO NOT open a PR to this repository.

### Expected Output and Submitting Your Work
We respect your time and don't want you to spend more than 2-3 hours. Please submit your work plan to amyzoeller@threeflow.com. *If* you have diagrams, notes, or any additional material that you'd like to submit that explains your line of thinking, you're welcome to include it with your submission.

### During the Follup Up Meeting
We will...
* Review and discuss your work plan
* Discuss the customer feedback and the schema file
* Address any questions you have
