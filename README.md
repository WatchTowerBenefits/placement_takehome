# ThreeFlow Placement Team Take Home Exercise

### Artifacts Provided
In this repository you'll find 5 artifacts:
* A schema file describing a portion of the application data model
* A collection of broker feedback
* A collection of carrier feedback
* A collection of internal stakeholder feedback
* A backlog of features that the placement team is considering

### Your Task
Using the information provided in the schema file and feedback sheets, your task is to choose ONE feature in the backlog and prepare a brief work plan (no more than one page) outlining your proposed approach given the requirements you know about.  If you'd like to fold in any assumptions you've gathered from avaiable feedback, please state those assumptions explicitly in your plan.

You may prepare your work plan in whatever format you're comfortable with.  Please DO NOT open a PR to this repository.

### During the Interview
We will...
* Review and discuss your work plan
* Discuss the customer feedback and the schema file
* Pair on a small (~20 mins) feature related to one of the backlog items
